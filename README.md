# Ellipse Analysis Script

This Python script analyzes an image containing an ellipse using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It extracts black points from the image, performs SVD, and plots the results including the fitted ellipse.



**Note:** This script assumes the ellipse in the image is black, and the background is white.

Feel free to customize the script for your specific use case.
